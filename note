I need a converter of a bus schedule document into semantic JSON. Input:

http://www.pksgryfice.com.pl/uploads/images/rja/gryfice.html (snapshot: https://web.archive.org/web/20181008002031/http://www.pksgryfice.com.pl/uploads/images/rja/gryfice.html )

Output JSON:
{
"valid_until": " 2019-06-19",
"destinations": [
{
  "to": "Brojce",
  "via": ["Radu≈Ñ skrz."],
  "express": 0,
  "departures": [
   {
    "time": "06:40",
    "modifiers": ["S", "3"],
.......

The Express field is 1 for entries in red.

The code should be able to parse all schedules linked from from http://www.pksgryfice.com.pl/autobusy/

The code should fail with an exception when the format changes and it can't parse all fields.
